## Factor and figure management

This is an R Markdown document elaborated to serve as a personal cheatsheet on the topic of factor and figure management.
For the exercises contained in this assignment, I chose to work with the `gapminder` dataset. 

## Loading data and required libraries 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gridExtra)
```

## Part 1: Factor management

*Factor inspection*

First, let's ensure the variables that I'll explore are factors.
This can be done by looking at the class of the variables.

```{r}
# showing str() output as a table
data.frame(variable = names(gapminder),
           class = sapply(gapminder, class),
           levels = sapply(gapminder, nlevels),
           first_values = sapply(gapminder, function(x) paste0(head(x),  collapse = ", ")),
           row.names = NULL) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "center")
```

In the table above we can see the classes of all variables. The variables `country` and `continent` are indeed factors, `country` has 142 levels and `continent` has 5 levels.

**Explore the effects of `arrange()`**

Does merely arranging the data have any effect on a figure?

Here, I'll explore what happens to a figure after sorting the data with the `arrange()` function. I'll order the `continent` variable according to the minimum value of life expectancy. 

First let's check that `arrange()` works:

```{r}
#new dataset with continent and minimum lifeExp
gap_minlifeExp <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(minlife = min(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(minlife)

kable(gap_minlifeExp) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
  
```

We can see that the data in the table was indeed arranged by the minimum value of life expectancy in each continent in ascending order. 

Now let's try arranging the data in a figure. For the purposes of plotting, I will join the dataset `gap_minlifeExp` created above with the `gapminder` dataset and arrange the data using `minlife` as before. 

```{r}
gap_new <- left_join(gapminder, gap_minlifeExp, by = "continent") #join datasets to create a boxplot


gap_new %>% 
  arrange(minlife) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2") + #change color palette
  guides(fill=FALSE) + #remove unnecessary color legend
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() #select theme
```

As we can see, in the figure the data wasn't arranged as it was in the output table, instead, continents are sorted alphabetically. 


**Explore the effects of reordering a factor**

What effect does this have on a figure?

Here I will try to sort the data of the same figure but using `reorder()` instead. 

```{r}
gap_new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(continent, minlife), y = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2") + #change color palette
  guides(fill=FALSE) + #remove unnecessary color legend
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() #select theme
```

As the `reorder()` function does reorders the levels of the factor, the continents in the figure are now ordered as desired (by minimum life expectancy).


### Drop Oceania

In this section, I'll flter the `gpminder` data to remove observations associated with the continent of Oceania. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

```{r}
gap_no_oceania <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania")

str(gap_no_oceania)
```

Looking at the structure, we can see that the number of observations in `gap_no_oceania` is different from the original `gapminder` dataset: 1680 vs. 1704 respectiveley, however the number of levels in both `country` and `continent` is still the same. 

Let's look at the unique values in `gap_no_oceania`
```{r}
summary(gap_no_oceania$continent)
```

We can see that the observations from Oceania were removed but is still in the factor levels.

Let's remove Oceania from the levels:

```{r}
gap_no_oceania <- droplevels(gap_no_oceania)
nlevels(gap_no_oceania$continent) #check the number of levels
summary(gap_no_oceania$continent) #check which are the remaining levels 
```

As noted, we are now left with 4 levels. The Oceania level was removed by using `droplevels()`, this function drops unused levels from a factor, since Oceania didn't have observations anymore it was dropped. 

### Reorder the levels of `continent`

Here, I will use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on the maxmimum value of gdp per capita.
I'm interested in looking at the growth in gdp in countries from the Americas from the last 20 years of data (1987-2007)

First let's calculate the growth in this period:

```{r}
gap_gdp <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Americas", year %in% c(1987, 2007)) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) %>%
  spread(key = year, value = gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(growth = (`2007` - `1987`)/`1987`*100) %>% #calculate percentage of change
  arrange(growth)

kable(gap_gdp) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

As we can see, the continents were arranged by the growth in GDP, but let's remember that it doesn't change the order of levels. I will use `fct_reorder` to make my plot look nicer and compare with ploting without reordering. 

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
p1 <- ggplot(gap_gdp, aes(x = country, y = growth)) +
  #geom_point()+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "", y = "Change in GDP (%)", title = "GDP growth in the Americas, 1987-2007")
p2 <- ggplot(gap_gdp, aes(x = fct_reorder(country, growth), y = growth )) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "", y = "Change in GDP (%)", title = "Ordered by economic growth")
  
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

```


### Part 2: File I/O

#### `write_csv()`

First, I'll check again that levels are saved 

```{r}
class(gap_gdp$country)  # corroborate that it is factor
gap_gdp <- gap_gdp %>%
            mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, growth)) # Change factor levels to non-alphabetical

levels(gap_gdp$country) # corroborate reordering

# Save the dataframe into a csv file
write_csv(gap_gdp, "hw05_factor_figure_mgmt_files/gap_gdp.csv")

```

#### `read_csv()`

```{r}
# Read in the data frame
gap_growth_new <- read_csv(file = "hw05_factor_figure_mgmt_files/gap_gdp.csv", col_names = TRUE)
levels(gap_growth_new$country)
gap_growth_new

class(gap_growth_new$country)  # check class
```

The dataframe before generating the csv file considered `country` as a factor. 
After opening the same file, the `country` variable is considered as character.

#### `saveRDS()`

Now lets try with `saveRDS`
```{r}
saveRDS(gap_gdp, "hw05_factor_figure_mgmt_files/gap_gdp_factor.rds")

```

#### `readRDS()`


```{r}
gap_growth_rds <- readRDS("hw05_factor_figure_mgmt_files/gap_gdp_factor.rds")
levels(gap_growth_rds$country)
class(gap_growth_rds$country)
```

We can see that `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()` conserve the datatypes when saving and reading an rds file.

#### `dput()`

```{r}
dput(gap_gdp, "hw05_factor_figure_mgmt_files/gap_gdp_factor.txt")
```


#### `dget()`

```{r}
gap_growth_dget <- dget("hw05_factor_figure_mgmt_files/gap_gdp_factor.txt")
levels(gap_growth_dget$country)
class(gap_growth_dget$country)
```

Similar with `RDS`, We can see that `dput()` and `dget()` conserve the datatypes when saving and reading a txt file.
