Hello! :raising_hand:

This is the repository of my homework 5 for the [STAT545](http://stat545.com) course.

Instructions for this assignment can be found [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw05/hw05.html)

The goals of this assignment are:

* Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
* Write some data to file and load it back into R.
* Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
* Make a plotly visual.
* Implement visualization design principles.

Here is a link to my [markdown document](hw05_factor_figure_mgmt.md) wich contains the exercises from this homework.
